### A minimal ad list (for now)

#### How do I add it to my Pi-Hole server?
Go to where you can add custom filters and type in:
https://tc012.gtk.cl/xa-adlist/cfads.txt (if you can't connect to https use http :))

#### Install it on Windows (easy) 
by using this script to change the hosts file and make sure to run it as Administator :D
